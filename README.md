# [Exercise] Scanner Class

In this exercise we will do the following:

* Clone a Git repository into your Projects folder
* Open an existing project in IntelliJ
* Create an application that converts values between weight units
* Create three classes, including two service objects
* Create an enum representing weight units
* Handle and validate user input from the terminal
* Orchestrate interactions between multiple classes
* Run tests

## Instructions

Note: This exercise is significantly larger than previous exercises. Be sure to read the instructions in the classes and be meticulous in your work.

1. Start by opening a new Terminal session.

2. Change into your Projects directory using the `cd` command:

	`cd ~/Projects`

3. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/tiy-raleigh-java/user-input-scanner-class) using the `git clone` command:

	`git clone git@github.com:tiy-raleigh-java/user-input-scanner-class.git`

	This should create a new directory at `~/Projects/user-input-scanner-class`.

4. Open this project in IntelliJ

5. Find the `Main` class, open it, and follow the instructions in the comments therein. You will end up writing three classes and one enum to complete this project. 

6. When you're ready to run this code, select "Run all tests (All in user-input-scanner-class)" in the drop down menu at the top of the screen and click the green Run button to the right.

7. If the tests pass, then you're done!
